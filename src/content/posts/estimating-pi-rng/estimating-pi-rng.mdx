# Introduction

Here's a cool problem: You're given a random number generator, and you have to use it to estimate
the value of pi.

At first this may seem like a pretty tricky task, at least it seemed that way to me. I mean how are
we supposed to suss out pi just by generating random numbers? Sure they're both mathematical
concepts, but even if random number generation and pi are both islands in the Sea of Math, sailing
from the former to the latter just doesn't seem like a very feasible route. We won't be embarking in
any ordinary ship, though, nor under unfavorable conditions. No, our vessel will be crafted with the
legendary strength of Euclidean geometry, and in our sails we will catch the fortunate winds of
probability and statistics. With these allies on our side, we'll see that solving this problem is
actually pretty smooth sailing.

# The Geometry

Forgetting about the random number generator (RNG) for a while, let's think about pi for a bit. I
know for me at least pi makes me think of circles. So let's draw a circle. Specifically, let's draw
the unit circle, since it tends to make calculations easier what with having a radius of 1:

<UnitCircle useDarkMode={useDarkMode} colors={colors} Plot={BlogPlot} />

So we've got this unit circle, and we know its radius is 1, and we also know that its area is equal
to pi times the square of its radius. That is,

<KaTexComponent
  texExpression="A = \pi {r^2} = \pi {\lparen 1 \rparen}^2 = \pi."
  options={{ displayMode: true }}
/>

Now, that's a nice circle on that grid there, but it could use some pizzazz. Let's circumscribe a
square about it:

<UnitCircle
  withBigSquare={true}
  withSquare={true}
  useDarkMode={useDarkMode}
  colors={colors}
  Plot={BlogPlot}
/>

That's better. We know the area of our new square there is $A = l^2 = 2^2 = 4$, so this means that
the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square is

<KaTexComponent
  texExpression="\frac {A_{circle}} {A_{square}} = \frac \pi 4,"
  options={{ displayMode: true }}
/>

which gives us

<KaTexComponent
  texExpression="4 \lparen \frac {A_{circle}} {A_{square}} \rparen = \pi."
  options={{ displayMode: true }}
/>

If only we could approximate $\frac {A_{circle}} {A_{square}}$ with our RNG. If we could, then we
could also just plug that value into the formula above to get an approximation for pi.

# The Probability and Statistcs

Adding the square frame to our circle above was really a nice touch, but I think we can do even
more. It could use some dots, no? Not in any particular order, though. Let's throw in some points on
the plane _at random_, inside the square we drew. You know, like the kind of points
$\lparen x,y \rparen$ you could pick by _randomly_ selecting their x-values and y-values (or better
yet, having an RNG do it for you).

<UnitCircle
  withBigSquare={true}
  withSquare={true}
  data={[
    {
      x: [0.349, 0.592, -0.978, -0.54, -0.52, -0.749, -0.383, 0.511, 0.905, 0.17],
      y: [-0.577, -0.361, 0.168, -0.722, 0.815, 0.769, 0.867, 0.329, 0.925, -0.115],
      type: "scatter",
      mode: "markers",
      marker: { color: useDarkMode ? colors["trim-dark"] : colors["secondary-light"], size: 4 },
    },
  ]}
  useDarkMode={useDarkMode}
  colors={colors}
  Plot={BlogPlot}
/>

That looks pretty neat, huh? Yeah, I think so. But importantly, this could be the thing that links
our RNG to an estimate of pi. Let's ponder a question for a moment: If we select a point at random
from within the bounds of the square, what is the probability that it is _also_ within the circle?
Well, if we assume that our randomly-selected point has an equal chance of falling _anywhere_ within
the square[^uni-distro], then the probability that it will fall inside the circle is equal to the
fraction of the square's area that the circle takes up. That is, a randomly-selected point has a
$\frac {A_{circle}} {A_{square}}$ chance of falling inside the circle.

Now, we know that the probability a coin toss will result in heads is $\frac 1 2$, so we know that
if we were to flip a coin 100 times, about 50 of those tosses will probably come up heads. In fact,
the more we flip the coin, the closer $\frac {heads} {total~tosses}$ stably approaches $\frac 1 2$.

Applying the same principle[^big-nums] to our random points, we know that each single point has
probability $\frac {A_{circle}} {A_{square}}$ of falling inside the circle, so the more points we
generate, the closer $\frac {points~inside~circle} {total~points}$ stably approaches
$\frac {A_{circle}} {A_{square}}$.

So now we have the missing link in our pi estimation: a way to estimate
$\frac {A_{circle}} {A_{square}}$ using a random number generator.

# Putting It All Together

Taking a look at the point-speckled plane above, we can conclude visually that out of the 10
randomly-generated points, 8 of them fall within the bounds of the circle (mathematically this is
done by applying the Pythagorean theorem to each point; that is, for some point $p = (x, y)$, $p$
lies within the circle if $\sqrt {x^2 + y^2} \le 1$). Anyway, this means that our estimate for the
ratio of the area of the circle to that of the square is:

<KaTexComponent
  texExpression="\frac {A_{circle}} {A_{square}} \approx \frac {points~inside~circle} {total~points} = \frac {8} {10} = 0.8."
  options={{ displayMode: true }}
/>

Plugging this value into our pi-estimation formula, we get:

<KaTexComponent
  texExpression="\pi \approx 4 \lparen \frac {points~inside~circle} {total~points} \rparen = 4 \times 0.8 = 3.6."
  options={{ displayMode: true }}
/>

Estimating pi to be 3.6 doesn't seem so far off; let's determine the error for our estimate:

<KaTexComponent
  texExpression="error = \frac {|\pi - (estimated~value)|} {\pi} = \frac {|\pi - 3.6|} {\pi} \approx 0.146."
  options={{ displayMode: true }}
/>

Fifteen percent error, alright. For sure we can do better with more points, but first let's make our
life a little bit easier.

## Just a Quarter

For visualization purposes, it's useful to use the whole unit circle and the accompanying
circumscribed square in demonstrating this estimation method. We don't actually need the whole of
each of them, though. Rather than generating points in the $[-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]$ area as we have
been, we could just generate points in the unit square, $[0, 1] \times [0, 1]$, as depicted below.

<UnitCircle withSquare={true} useDarkMode={useDarkMode} colors={colors} Plot={BlogPlot} />

Our estimate still works because

<KaTexComponent
  texExpression="4 \lparen \frac {area~of~unit~circle~in~first~quadrant} {area~of~unit~square} \rparen = 4 \lparen \frac {\pi \cdot 1^2 \div 4} {1^2} \rparen = \pi."
  options={{ displayMode: true }}
/>

We just estimate $\frac {area~of~unit~circle~in~first~quadrant} {area~of~unit~square}$ and mulitiply
it by four to get our estimated pi value, and luckily we can do the same probability trick as
before. In fact, we could do the same with any of the four quadrants, and our estimate would still
work.

## Estimation in Action

Now let's see our estimation method at work. If we were to zoom in on the unit square from the last
figure, we'd get something like this:

<PiEstimateVisualizer
  minPoints={1}
  maxPoints={500}
  initialPoints={20}
  useDarkMode={useDarkMode}
  colors={colors}
  Plot={BlogPlot}
/>

Go ahead and play around with the number of random points using the slider. If you want to try with
a new set of random points, refresh the page. You should be able to see that as you increase the
number of points, our estimate gets closer to the actual value, and the error reduces!

[^uni-distro]:
    We don't actually have to assume our random variable is uniformly distributed, at least not with
    the RNG used in this post. JavaScript's `Math.random()` has an "approximately uniform
    distribution" (according to the
    [official documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random)).
    Further, the distribution of our X-variable is independent from that of our Y-variable, so their
    [joint distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_probability_distribution#Joint_distribution_for_independent_variables)
    is their product. Knowing that the support of both distributions is the same interval, we can
    conclude that their joint distribution is also uniform on the area (square) defined by the
    Cartesian product of their respective supports.

[^big-nums]:
    This is known as the [law of large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers).
