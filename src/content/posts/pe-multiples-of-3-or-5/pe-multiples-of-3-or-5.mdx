**Warning:** This post contains spoilers about
[Problem #1: Multiples of 3 or 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1), from
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)! If you would not like to know my solution, please do not

# Introduction

A few weeks ago, I decided to start a new hobby: Project Euler. That is, I'm setting out to solve
Project Euler problems and write about my attempts at doing so here. I had been missing mathematics
for some time, and I was in search for something I could program and also write about. This first
problem, though only rated 5% difficulty by Project Euler, certainly gave me what I was looking for,
and I hope you'll enjoy reading about my thought process and solutions. So without further ado,
let's get into the problem!

# Problem Statement

**Multiples of 3 or 5:**

_If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The
sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000._

# Solving the Problem

## A Note on My Chalkboard

While tackling this problem, I took advantage of my laptop's touch screen and an awesome stylus pen
my Mom got me to map out my thoughts by hand in Microsoft Whiteboard. Liking the look and feel of
old-school chalkboards, I decided to make the background of my whiteboard black, and my pen color
white. Although the screen and stylus don't have quite the same sound and feel as real chalk on a
real chalkboard, it's much easier for me to share my notes electronically this way. If you're
interested in viewing them, I've made them available as a zoom-able, drag-able PNG at the bottom of
this post, and if you don't want to scroll to get there, you can follow [this link](#chalkboard) or
the one in the table of contents as well.

## First Steps: Notation

The first thing I did, partly because I really like notation and mostly because it helps me start
thinking about problems mathematically, was to try to formalize the problem in semi-mathematical
notation. You can take a look at [my notes](#chalkboard) to see this written by hand, but I've also
provided the same below with KateX (and more correct notation).

Here I'll define the set of numbers to sum from the problem's example. This could probably and maybe
more properly be done as a sequence, but I like
[set-builder notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-builder_notation).

<KaTexComponent
  texExpression="A = \{a | a \in \natnums \land a < 10 \land (a\mod 3 \equiv 0 \lor a\mod 5 \equiv 0) \}"
  options={{ displayMode: true }}
/>

We're defining a set $A$ with elements $a$, where each $a$ is in the
[set of natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number) and is less than 10. Further,
when dividing an $a$ by 3 or 5, the remainder must be 0 (see
[Congruence](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Congruence.html)). This last property is equivalent to
saying that each $a$ is a multiple of 3 or 5, but looking at things this way makes it easier to
solve this problem programmatically.

Then, the following represents the sum of the elements of $A$ (unordered, but that
[doesn't make a difference in this situation](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1158041)):
$\displaystyle\sum_{a \in A}a$.

Following the same process for the sum that the problem actually wants us to find, I'll start once
again by defining a set:

<KaTexComponent
  texExpression="B = \{b | b \in \natnums \land b < 1000 \land (b\mod 3 \equiv 0 \lor b\mod 5 \equiv 0) \}"
  options={{ displayMode: true }}
/>

The only differences this time are the name of the set ($B$), the names of its elements ($b$) and
importantly the exclusive maximum value of 1000.

Then, the sum of the elements in $B$, the answer we're after, can be written:
$\displaystyle\sum_{b \in B}b$.

Now, let's get to seeing how we can solve this problem with some code.

## A Simple Solution

To me, the most obvious solution was to step through all the natural numbers less than 1000,
checking whether each is divisible by 3 or 5, and, if that condition was met, add the number to a
running sum. You can see my exact implementation
[on my GitHub](https://github.com/ThomasLatham/project-euler/blob/main/src/multiplesOf3Or5/multiplesOf3Or5.ts),
and I'll also paste the function below:

```TypeScript
/**
 * Uses brute force to solve the problem.
 *
 * @param maxAddend The maximum addend to be added to the sum.
 * @returns The sum of all numbers less than `maxAddend` which are divisible by 3 or 5.
 */
const simpleSolution = (maxAddend: number): number => {
  let sum: number = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i < maxAddend; i++) {
    if (i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0) {
      sum += i;
    }
  }
  return sum;
};
```

We can see that this function, as it's just a single loop, runs in $O(n)$. This is good, but it
would be nice to see if we can apply some mathematical concepts and methods to make a more elegant
solution.

## A More Elegant Solution

As my notes show, one of my first steps in searching for a cleaner solution to this problem was to
list out the sequence of natural numbers divisible by 3 or 5, and then to write out the sequence of
differences between each consecutive term in the first sequence, with the intent of finding a
pattern in the second sequence. For the natural numbers divisible by 3 or 5, we have:

<KaTexComponent
  texExpression="\{0, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 30, ...\}."
  options={{ displayMode: true }}
/>

For the sequence of differences between each term, we have:

<KaTexComponent
  texExpression="\{3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, ...\}."
  options={{ displayMode: true }}
/>

We can see with some analysis that this sequence of differences repeats itself! The sequence's
repeating pattern is $\{3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3\}$, and the pattern always starts again when we reach a
number in the first sequence which is divisible by both 3 and 5 (e.g., 0, 15, 30). There are
probably some number theory principles (relatively prime numbers, modular arithmetic) I could apply
here to formalize why this pattern is happening and to prove that it does indeed hold as the first
sequence approaches infinity, but for this problem I'm just going to assume the latter.

With this assumption in mind, we can devise a new algorithm for computing the sum of the multiples
of 3 and 5 below 1000. This time we'll still keep track of the the running sum, but we'll also
define the pattern in an array and keep track of the value of the current addend (that is, the
number to add to the running sum). Then we'll iteratively perform the following two steps: Add the
current addend to the running sum, then increment the current addend by the next number in the
pattern. This way, we'll never have to check whether an addend is a multiple of 3 or 5, and we have
fewer iterations to loop through until we reach the answer. My implementation is below:

```TypeScript
/**
 * Solves the problem by taking advantage of the fact that, in the sequence of
 * natural numbers divisible by 3 or 5, there is a pattern to determine how
 * much greater the n+1st element is than the nth.
 *
 * @param maxAddend The maximum addend to be added to the sum.
 * @returns The sum of all numbers less than `maxAddend` which are divisible by 3 or 5.
 */
const sequenceDifferencePatternSolution = (maxAddend: number): number => {
  const pattern: number[] = [3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3];
  let curAddend: number = 0;
  let sum: number = 0;
  let patternIndex = 0;

  while (curAddend < maxAddend) {
    sum += curAddend;
    curAddend += pattern[patternIndex++ % 7];
  }

  return sum;
};
```

# Conclusion

So we've seen two different ways to solve this first problem from Project Euler. There are certainly
different and more efficient ways to do so, perhaps in $O(1)$ time complexity, but this was a great
way for me to get started with the Project and get back into math. Thanks for reading! If you have
