# Introduction

This post is the first in a (hopefully) weekly series devoted to describing what I've learned in the
past week about formal methods, which I'll describe just below this introduction. This week I
learned about different ways to go about familiarizing myself with the field as well as resources
for helping me learn.

I recently (as of the publishing date of this post) learned about the field of formal methods, which
involves using formal mathematical methods to prove the correct operation of software. As a software
engineer with an educational background in mathematics and a start to my career in QA, this field
seemed right up my alley.

I'm sure it appeals to many others who enjoy proving things and having software that works well. If,
like me, you've found yourself drawn to this filed but don't know where to start, then perhaps this
post can serve you in the same way it serves me: as a starting point to explore formal methods.

# The Curriculum

In order to establish a well-rounded approach to the curriculum, I am going to use a three-pronged
approach to learning:

1. Theory: The theoretical foundations upon which mathematically sound software rests.
2. Application: Tools used in the industry to mathematically verify programs.
3. Projects: Combining the theory and application to make contributions in the community.

The driving idea is to devote roughly equal effort to each of these three areas. I plan to produce
weekly blog posts describing what I learned in each of these three areas in the past week, where
this post serves as the first post in the series

## Theory

I'm going to start with
[_Lectures on the Curry-Howard Isomorphism_](https://disi.unitn.it/~bernardi/RSISE11/Papers/curry-howard.pdf)
by SÃ¸rensen and Urzyczyn. The Curry-Howard Isomorphism establishes an incredible correspondence
between Proof Theory and Type Theory, often summarized as "Proofs are programs." This text lays the
groundwork for both of those areas, covering different logics in proof theory and the corresponding
types.

[//]: # "TODO: Talk about *why* this text and the topics it covers are good as a theoretical start."

## Application

I'm going to study
[_Logical Foundations_](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/index.html) by Pierce
et al, which covers "basic concepts of logic, computer-assisted theorem proving, the Coq proof
assistant, functional programming" and others (from the Preface). I've found this text, which is the
first volume in the _Software Foundations_ series, is often referenced as a great starting point for
learning the nuts and bolts of formal methods.

## Projects

With the goal of participating in [Certora Prover Contents](https://www.certora.com/contests), which
are competitions for securing real smart contracts with real monetary rewards, I'm going to do the
[Certora Prover tutorial](https://docs.certora.com/projects/tutorials/en/latest/lesson1_prerequisites/index.html).
While not _directly_ applying what is covered in the resources I'm using for the other two learning
foci, this will certainly be related, and what's more it's the most accessible source I've found for
getting involved in meaningful contributions as soon as possible.

# Conclusion

I'm looking forward to learning about formal methods and sharing what I learn here. If you found
this post helpful in any way or you have questions, feel free to reach out to me at
