# Introduction

I recently (as of the publishing date of this post) learned about the field of formal methods, which
uses formal mathematical methods to ensure the correct operation of software. As a software engineer
with an educational background in mathematics and a start to my career in QA, this field seemed
right up my alley. What's more, the math involved in Formal Methods is of the proving-things variety
(in this case proving that a program runs according to a specification), which is probably my
favorite part of math.

I naturally wanted to learn more about formal methods, but I didn't know where to start: theory,
application, project-based learning? On one hand, I quickly came to realize that there exists a
somewhat significant theoretical prerequisite to making meaningful contributions to the field, and
on the other hand I felt like I wanted to start contributing as soon as possible in an applied way.
All these considerations, while worthy to consider, ultimately led to analysis paralysis, where I
didn't make any progress at all towards learning about formal methods because I was too concerned
with where to begin.

To solve this dilemma and start getting somewhere - anywhere - I designed this curriculum, a working
document, which is broken into three sections:

1. Theory: The theoretical foundations upon which mathematically sound software rests.
2. Application: Tools used in the industry to mathematically verify programs.
3. Projects: Combining the theory and application to make contributions in the _community_.

The driving idea is that I will devote equal effort to each of these three areas, all the while
using this document to keep track of the subjects I've covered and where I learned them, as well as
project-based endeavors on which I've worked. In this way, I hope to obtain a well-rounded
background in formal methods.

Importantly, this curriculum is a working document that I plan on updating frequently as I progress
in my learning and discover new educational/project resources. As such this post not only serves as
the trail I'm taking in this journey, but also as the high-level account of how I'm blazing that
trail, and in that way it also a source of motivation for me to keep at it.

# Theory

1. The Curry-Howard Correspondence:

2. The Tezos Scientist path: https://opentezos.com/paths/

- gets you versed in blockchain basics, a language for smart contracting
- this sets the stage for allowing the _application_ for formal verification
- then this touches on formal verification

3. idk what's next

# Application

# Projects
