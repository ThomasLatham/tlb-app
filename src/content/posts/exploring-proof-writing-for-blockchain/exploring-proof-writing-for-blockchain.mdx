# Introduction

I recently learned about the field of formal verification, which roughly speaking is the field of
using mathematics (i.e., formal methods) to ensure the correct operation of systems. For systems
where it's obviously paramount to "get it right on the first try," such as building a bridge or
spaceship, I think it's perhaps equally obvious that you'll want to employ mathematics in the
development process to make sure you don't have any issues in your finished product. In these cases,
the field of formal methods is probably pretty baked into the engineering process. For less critical
systems, though, like most software applications, the idea of using math to rigorously route out any
bugs before releasing to production is more of a foreign concept and probably a waste of resources
in most cases â€” unit testing, integration testing, manual testing and other forms of software
testing usually are sufficient for that purpose.

There does exist a non-empty intersection between the set of systems with a high degree of "get it
right on the first try"-ness and the set of systems which are software applications, however, and
one such element in that intersection is the creation of smart contracts. Indeed, as of the time of
writing this, there are many companies such as Cardano, FinProof and Informal Systems, which are
using formal methods in blockchain development.

This is really exciting to me because (a.) I'm a huge fan of proving things mathematically and (b.)
I also find it really satisfying to make sure software works correctly (I started my tech career in
QA after all). Now that I think about it, you could maybe say in a loose sort of way that I used
formal methods to verify my program for
[this Project Euler problem](../pe-even-fibonacci-numbers-2/pe-even-fibonacci-numbers-2.mdx). In any
case, I've decided that I want to dive into this promising world that combines proofs and software
correctness, and this post is a written record of that leap off the metaphorical diving board.

So, without further ado, let's explore some of the technologies that are being used today by formal
methods engineers to ensure the correct operation of smart contracts.
