# Introduction

Keeping in the spirit of [last week's post](../wiltw-fm-learning-path/wiltw-fm-learning-path.mdx),
but departing somewhat significantly from the learning path there established, this week I furthered
my knowledge in formal methods by analyzing the first section (and part of the second section) of
the paper _Vehicle: Bridging the Embedding Gap in the Verification of Neuro-Symbolic
Programs_[^vehicle] by Daggit et al (link to

# What I Learned

Although I've only so far made it through the first few pages of this paper, I feel I have gained a
solid introduction to the embedding gap. This paper introduces the concept by:

## 1. Establishing a High-Level Model

Establishing a high-level model for how a neuro-symbolic program (that is, a program which contains
both machine learning elements as well as ordinary symbolic code) can be verified. Proving the
validity of a neuro-symbolic program under this model comes down to 3 lemmas:

- (a.) proving that a neural network obeys certain property,
- (b.) proving that if a network obeys that property, then that network wrapped in/_embedded in the
  program by_ defined functions to map the network's inputs and outputs to domain-understandable
  data obeys another property and
- (c.) that for all such wrapped networks, when they themselves are embedded in a defined symbolic
  program, then the program obeys another property.

## 2. Describing Challenges in Proving

Describing challenges in proving these lemmas in the linked way described above. ITPs (interactive
theorem provers, like Agda and Coq, which enable users to define theorems as types and then prove
those theorems by giving values to those types) are good at helping proof engineers prove lemmas of
the third variety (c.) ATPs (automated theorem provers, like Reluplex, which allow proving theorems
in an automated way after defining them and which I admittedly understand even less than ITPs) are
good at proving lemmas of the first variety (a.). Neither are good at lemmas of the second variety
however.

The _embedding gap_ then is the lack of tools available to prove that a network (verified for some
property), when embedded by input/output translating functions (we call this
network-wrapped-in-embedding-functions combo a _system_), obeys a system property, and further to
link that result to something digestible by an ITP. There are other challenges, but this describes
the main challenge of bridging the embedding gap.

## 3. Describing a High-Level Architectural Solution (Vehicle)

Describing a high-level architectural solution for bridging the embedding gap. First the user
expresses the specification for the solution property and necessarily then also the embedding and
unembedding functions, in terms of the domain-specific language that is semantically meaningful to
practitioners in the domain.

Then, via `vehicle-lang`, that system property is compiled down to the network property in the
embedding space in a form that is usable for training and verification. Finally, after verification
of the network property, the original solution spec is exported to an ITP so its proof can be
integrated into a proof of the program property. This results in proving all the lemmas in a
connected interlinked way!

# What I'm Continuing to Learn

Now that I've obtained a solid-enough foundation of the problem that Vehicle solves, as well as how
it solves it, I've started on the second part of the paper which follows a motivating example
through the whole Vehicle workflow. This is requiring me to gain a baseline understanding of, among
other things (but first this), the ITP Agda, which itself requires me to understand dependently
typed languages. It's been a learning process, but I'm making steady progress. I've been starting to
gain an understanding of the Curry-Howard Isomorphism through this, which I touched on earlier:
Proof-theoretical theorems _are_ type-theoretical types, and proof-theoretical proofs _are_
type-theoretical programs.
