**Warning:** This post contains spoilers about
[Problem #2: Even Fibonacci Numbers](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2), from
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)! If you would not like to know my solution, please do not
read on.

# Introduction

This is the first post in a series I'm making for Project Euler problem \#2. I started out by
writing just a single long post for the problem, but in revisiting my notes to prepare the writeup,
better solutions kept cropping up, building on my previous findings. With each solution having its
own proof, the content grew too large in my opinion for a single post, so I'm rather going to
release one post for each new solution.

My journey with this problem started out with the solution which to me seemed the most straight
forward, and while that method proved good enough to produce a correct answer, I had a strong
feeling that the algorithm could be further optimized. I therefore set out to find a more efficient
approach, and noticing a neat pattern in the Fibonacci sequence (a pattern that has since become the
focus of this post), I devised a way to prove it inductively.

We'll see though that even when applying the proven pattern, the computation for the problem's
answer still took exactly as many steps as my first method. Still, exploring patterns can be a lot
of fun, and sometimes what you find at a seemingly dead end can be the key to what you were looking
for all along.

# Problem Statement

**Even Fibonacci Numbers:**

_Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting
with $\textit 1$ and $\textit 2$, the first terms will be:_

<KaTexComponent
  texExpression="\textit{1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...}"
  options={{ displayMode: true }}
/>

_By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find
the sum of the even-valued terms._

# My Intuitive Approach

My initial approach to this problem was to iteratively (as opposed to recursively) generate the
Fibonacci numbers, checking in each step whether the current number is even, and if so adding it to
a running sum. You can see the source code for my implementation of this solution
[here](https://github.com/ThomasLatham/project-euler/blob/main/src/evenFibonacciNumbers/evenFibonacciNumbers.ts)
and in the code snippet below:

```TypeScript
/**
 * Sums the even Fibonacci numbers, up to and including the given `maxAddend`.
 *
 * @param maxAddend The maximum addend to be added to the sum.
 * @returns The sum of all even Fiboannci numbers less than or equal to the `maxAddend`.
 */
const sumEvenFibonacciNumbers = (maxAddend: number): number => {
  let prev: number = 1;
  let cur: number = 1;
  let sum: number = 0;

  while (cur <= maxAddend) {
    sum += cur % 2 == 0 ? cur : 0;
    const temp = cur;
    cur += prev;
    prev = temp;
  }

  return sum;
};
```

There's nothing fancy going on here, and I think it's the most direct way to solve the problem.
Since the $n^{\text{th}}$ Fibonacci number is defined as the $(n-1)^{\text{st}}$ plus the
$(n-2)^{\text{nd}}$, programmatically we just run a loop, adding the previous Fibonacci number to
the current one to get the next. If the current value is even (i.e., its remainder when divided by
$2$ is equal to $0$), then we add it to a running sum, and when the current Fibonacci number exceeds
the value we passed to the function as `maxAddend` ($4,000,000$ for the Project Euler Problem), we
exit the loop and return the running sum.

Aside from examining the internals of this method, we can also see from my initialization of both
`prev` and `cur` to $1$ that this implementation's definition of the Fibonacci numbers differs
slightly from the one provided by Project Euler, with no bearing on the correctness of the
algorithm. In more detail, I'm defining the sequence as

<KaTexComponent
  texExpression="\textit{0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...}"
  options={{ displayMode: true }}
/>

As a function, $\mathcal{F}$,
[whose domain is the natural numbers](https://www.berkeleycitycollege.edu/wjeh/files/2013/01/precalculus_note_sequence_series.pdf)
($\mathbb{N}$), we can define this sequence as follows:

<KaTexComponent
  texExpression="
    \mathcal{F}(n) = 
      \begin{cases}
        n& n \in \lbrace 0, 1 \rbrace \\
        \mathcal{F}(n - 1) + \mathcal{F}(n - 2)& n \geq 2
      \end{cases}
"
  options={{ displayMode: true }}
/>

# A Cool Pattern: Even-Odd-Odd

The previous function certainly solves the problem, and indeed it was the one I used to find the
correct answer that I entered into the Project Euler website for validation. After doing so,
however, I wanted to find a more efficient solution, so I started analyzing the Fibonacci sequence
to try to discover any patterns that might prove useful in that endeavor. One that popped out at me
was that it seemed that every third Fibonacci number was even, with the two following terms being
odd. Verifying against the first few terms listed above, we can see how this was seeming to be the
case:

<KaTexComponent
  texExpression="\textit{0 (even), 1 (odd), 1 (odd), 2 (even), 3
  (odd), 5 (odd), 8 (even), ...}"
  options={{ displayMode: true }}
/>

## Proof by Induction

What is a neat pattern, though, without proof? Before implementing a TypeScript function based on
this finding, I wanted to prove that it was true for the whole Fibonacci sequence, and not just for
the first few terms. Recalling the multitude of times I used it in my undergrad to prove some
pattern to be true for some sequence, my initial thought was to use
[mathematical induction](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/mathematical-induction.html), and this
ended up doing the trick.

I also used some Number Theory to help me out, specifically
[congruence modulo](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/congruence-modulo),
since it makes it easy to define and work the concepts of "even" and "odd" numbers. Precisely, a
number, $n$, is said to be even if $n \equiv 0 \pmod 2$, and it is odd if $n \equiv 1 \pmod 2$. This
is equivalent to saying that $n$ is even if its remainder when divided by $2$ is $0$, and $n$ is odd
if its remainder when divided by $2$ is $1$.

So, let's get into the proof. Formally, we want to prove that if $z \equiv 0
\pmod 3$ (or
[equivalently](https://math.libretexts.org/Courses/Monroe_Community_College/MTH_220_Discrete_Math/3%3A_Proof_Techniques/3.2%3A_Direct_Proofs)
that $z$ is a multiple of $3$), then:

- $\mathcal{F}(z) \equiv 0 \pmod 2$,
- $\mathcal{F}(z + 1) \equiv 1 \pmod 2$ and
- $\mathcal{F}(z + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod 2$.

To prove this statement by induction, we'll first demonstrate that it's true for $z = 0$:

- $\mathcal{F}(z) = \mathcal{F}(0) = 0 \equiv 0 \pmod 2$, ✔️
- $\mathcal{F}(z + 1) = \mathcal{F}(1) = 1 \equiv 1 \pmod 2$ ✔️ and
- $\mathcal{F}(z + 2) = \mathcal{F}(2) = 1 \equiv 1 \pmod 2$. ✔️

With that demonstrated, we'll now _assume_ that the pattern is true for some general $k$. That is,
for some $k$ such that

<KaTexComponent texExpression="k \gt 0 \land k \equiv 0 \pmod 3," options={{ displayMode: true }} />

we'll assume:

- $\mathcal{F}(k) \equiv 0 \pmod 2$,
- $\mathcal{F}(k + 1) \equiv 1 \pmod 2$ and
- $\mathcal{F}(k + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod 2$.

Now, we need to _show_ for that Fibonacci number which is $3$ "ahead" of $\mathcal{F}(k)$ (which we
can write as $\mathcal{F}(k+3)$), that our three points still hold. That is, we need to show that:

- $\mathcal{F}(k + 3) \equiv 0 \pmod 2$,
- $\mathcal{F}(k + 3 + 1) \equiv 1 \pmod 2$ and
- $\mathcal{F}(k + 3 + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod 2$.

Before showing that, it will be useful to note the following theorem (see Theorem 5.7.3
[here](<https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Combinatorics_and_Discrete_Mathematics/A_Spiral_Workbook_for_Discrete_Mathematics_(Kwong)/05%3A_Basic_Number_Theory/5.07%3A_Modular_Arithmetic>)):

If $a \equiv b \pmod n$ and $c \equiv d \pmod n$, then $a + c \equiv b + d \pmod
n$.

Using this theorem, we can show that for some $m_1$ and $m_2$, if $m_1 \equiv 1
\pmod 2$ and
$m_2 \equiv 1 \pmod 2$, then:

<KaTexComponent
  texExpression="
    \begin{aligned}
      &m_1 + m_2 \equiv 1 + 1 \pmod 2 \\
      \implies &m_1 + m_2 \equiv 2 \pmod 2 \\
      \implies &m_1 + m_2 \equiv 0 \pmod 2.
    \end{aligned}
  "
  options={{ displayMode: true }}
/>

With this theorem in mind, let's prove $\mathcal{F}(k+ 3) \equiv 0 \pmod 2$:

<KaTexComponent
  texExpression="
    \begin{aligned}
      &\mathcal{F}(k + 3) = \mathcal{F}(k + 3 - 1) + \mathcal{F}(k + 3 - 2)& [\text{definition }\mathcal{F}] \\
      \implies &\mathcal{F}(k + 3) = \mathcal{F}(k + 2) + \mathcal{F}(k + 1) \\
      \implies &\mathcal{F}(k + 3) \equiv 1 + 1 \pmod 2&  [\text{inductive assumption, Theorem 5.7.3}] \\
      \implies &\mathcal{F}(k + 3) \equiv 0 \pmod 2. 
    \end{aligned}"
  options={{ displayMode: true }}
/>

We can see in the third step that we're using two of the points we just assumed to be true, that
both $\mathcal{F}(k + 1)$ and $\mathcal{F}(k + 2)$ are congruent to $1 \pmod 2$[^full-assumption].

In a similar way, we'll prove the next point, $\mathcal{F}(k + 3 + 1) \equiv 1
\pmod 2$:

<KaTexComponent
  texExpression="
    \begin{aligned}
      &\mathcal{F}(k + 3 + 1) = \mathcal{F}(k + 3 + 1 - 1) + \mathcal{F}(k + 3 + 1 - 2)& [\text{definition }\mathcal{F}] \\
      \implies &\mathcal{F}(k + 3 + 1) = \mathcal{F}(k + 3) + \mathcal{F}(k + 2) \\
      \implies &\mathcal{F}(k + 3 + 1) \equiv 0 + 1 \pmod 2&  [\text{previous point, inductive assumption, Theorem 5.7.3}] \\
      \implies &\mathcal{F}(k + 3 + 1) \equiv 1 \pmod 2. 
    \end{aligned}"
  options={{ displayMode: true }}
/>

We can see in the third step that we're not only using our inductive assumption but also the result
of our previous point, that $\mathcal{F}(k+ 3) \equiv 0
\pmod 2$, in order to show the truth of this
point.

Lastly, we'll prove the third point, that $\mathcal{F}(k + 3 + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod
2$:

<KaTexComponent
  texExpression="
    \begin{aligned}
      &\mathcal{F}(k + 3 + 2) = \mathcal{F}(k + 3 + 2 - 1) + \mathcal{F}(k + 3 + 2 - 2)& [\text{definition }\mathcal{F}] \\
      \implies &\mathcal{F}(k + 3 + 2) = \mathcal{F}(k + 3 + 1) + \mathcal{F}(k + 3) \\
      \implies &\mathcal{F}(k + 3 + 2) \equiv 1 + 0 \pmod 2&  [\text{previous points, Theorem 5.7.3}] \\
      \implies &\mathcal{F}(k + 3 + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod 2. 
    \end{aligned}"
  options={{ displayMode: true }}
/>

We can see again in the third step that we're using the results of our previous points in order to
show the truth of the current point.

Now we've done what's required for mathematical induction:

- a.) We've demonstrated that the pattern holds for the first three elements of the sequence. That
  is, the first three elements follow the pattern even-odd-odd.
- b.) We've shown that if the pattern holds for any three elements in the sequence, starting with an
  even element, then the pattern will also hold for the three immediately after them. That is, if
  $\mathcal{F}(n)$, $\mathcal{F}(n + 1)$ and $\mathcal{F}(n + 2)$ follow the pattern even-odd-odd,
  then $\mathcal{F}(n + 3)$, $\mathcal{F}(n + 4)$ and $\mathcal{F}(n + 5)$ will follow the pattern
  even-odd-odd.

In this way, we've proven that the entire Fibonacci sequence follows the even-odd-odd pattern.
Looking at just the even terms, this means that $\mathcal{F}(3n)$ is even.

## A New Algorithm

Once I had finished the proof that every third Fibonacci number is even, I set out to implement an
algorithm using that fact — hopefully a more efficient one than my first approach. You can see that
implementation
[here](https://github.com/ThomasLatham/project-euler/blob/main/src/evenFibonacciNumbers/evenFibonacciNumbers.ts)
on my Github, as well as below:

```TypeScript
/**
 * Sums the every third Fibonacci number, up to and including the given `maxAddend`.
 *
 * @param maxAddend The maximum addend to be added to the sum.
 * @returns The sum of every third Fiboannci number less than or equal to the `maxAddend`.
 */
const sumEveryThirdFibonacciNumber = (maxAddend: number): number => {
  let prev: number = 1;
  let cur: number = 1;
  let sum: number = 0;
  let curIndex = 2;

  while (cur <= maxAddend) {
    sum += curIndex++ % 3 == 0 ? cur : 0;
    const temp = cur;
    cur += prev;
    prev = temp;
  }

  return sum;
};
```

Things look pretty similar to my first function, except instead of checking whether the current
Fibonacci number is even, we're checking if the remainder of its index when divided by $3$ is equal
to $0$. I thought it was neat, and I even wrote
[a little test](https://github.com/ThomasLatham/project-euler/blob/062fada2b0c473a1c58bdba598528f129293df9b/src/evenFibonacciNumbers/evenFibonacciNumbers.spec.ts#L35-L41)
to demonstrate that both functions return the same value given the same input (further validating
what we just proved), but importantly the new function is no more efficient than its predecessor.
It's arguably worse, in fact, because it uses more memory in order to keep track of the index of the
current Fibonacci number, stored in the `curIndex` variable.

# Reaching the Next Iteration

When I first realized the futility of my efforts, I was fairly disheartened and actually began
drafting this post along the lines of "I tried my best and proved something interesting, but I
didn't end up finding a better solution than what I originally came up with." A while later,
however, as I was playing around with the sequence of the _sums of even Fibonacci numbers_, the
number $4$ seemed to play a significant role, but exactly how I didn't quite yet see.

While not immediately useful to me in the sequence of sums, that curiosity around the number $4$ did
lead me to noticing a separate pattern in just the plain sequence of even Fibonacci numbers. With
this pattern I knew, if I could prove it did indeed hold for the whole sequence, that it would allow
me to implement a faster algorithm, even if just by a constant factor. With renewed enthusiasm, I
set up a way to prove the new pattern, and interestingly enough that method relied on the result
we've just proved in this post.

It just goes to show that even when your initial plans don't land you exactly where you were
expecting, sometimes simply exploring something, whether it's a pattern, or a new hobby or even a
fork in some trail you haven't yet taken, sometimes that can turn out to be exactly what you needed
after all.

If you're curious about the next solution I've just mentioned, check out
[the second part of this series](/posts/pe-even-fibonacci-numbers-2)!

[^full-assumption]:
    When I first set out to prove this pattern inductively, I limited what I was trying to prove to
    only the criteria that every third term was even, rather than also including that the two
    successive terms were odd. Even though the even terms are all I really cared about with respect
    to solving the Project Euler problem, this approach ended up fatal for the proof. Without
    including the odd terms in the proof's original statement, we don't get to include those points
    in the assumption step, and without those points in the assumption step, we can't demonstrate
    that $\mathcal{F}(k+3)$ is even.
